# About me

My name is Conner Charlebois and I'm a tinkerer. By day, I'm an Integration Engineer at Stripe, where I help businesses of all sizes to leverage Stripe to do more business online. 

By night, I'm the founder of Tiny Apps, LLC, a software development company that builds small apps with big impact. You can learn more about our work at [tinyappshq.net](https://www.tinyappshq.net).

When I'm not working, I'm a competitive amateur golfer, a Toronto Maple Leafs and Philadelphia Eagles fan, and a loving greyhound dad.
